Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States.

Over the past 24 hours, I've seen many of my friends say some pretty negative things about this fact.  There's a shadow over liberal America.  There's a lot of "how did it come to this," a lot of blame being thrown around, and a lot of anger and grief.

All these things have their time and place.  I don't believe that is here and now.

But how do you keep negativity from getting to you?  Whether something large, like a new president, or something small, like a mistake that makes you hate yourself a little, negativity is pervasive.  It can be hard to cope without descending into it.  For me, causal determinism helps.

<h2>What is Causal Determinism?</h2>

Causal determinism (pronounced "cause-ahl," not "casual") is a philisophical view on why things happen.  Put simply, it's the idea that things happen because prior conditions cause them to happen.

Well on its own, that seems pretty reasonable, right?  Things happen only because there were reasons for them to happen.  Well, to undersand why this is a controversial idea to many people, we can think about what it precludes.  If causal determinism is real, then free will doesn't exist, we're just making the only possibile decisions based upon our past and mental state. It also precludes luck, a fair number of religions, and some more well-known forms of determinism.

Okay, so maybe this isn't as clear cut as it originally sounded.  Remember that I'm not saying "this is how it is."  Causal determinism is a system of belief.  There is currently no way to prove it right or long.  Believing in it is a choice.

I absolutely do not think everyone should buy into this.  The implications are harsh, and if you aren't prepared to fully accept them, it will seem like a really depressing worldview.

<h3>Causal Determinism may be wrong for you if...</h3>

<h4>Free will is an important concept to you</h4>

This is a big one.  If free will factors strongly into your conception of yourself and the world, you are unlikely to be happy with causal determinism.  I'm not here to talk about whether or not free will is a real thing; if you want that discussion, you can find it basically anywhere.

<h4>You enjoy being angry</h4>

Anger can be cathartic.  It can feel good.  Raging at bad luck in a video game, or at someone who cut you off on the highway, or at basic injustice in society, can all feel right.  This is not a philosophy that encourages that.  Being angry at how the world is accomplishes nothing.  Things happened, now we're here. I don't mean to say that a causal determinist should ignore or avoid problems, but the philosophy lends itself more towards thinking about the future implications of the current situation than it does towards anger at the situation itself.

<h4>You want to believe in a deeper meaning</h4>

Causal determinism distinguishes itself from other types of determinism in that it doesn't care about the future.  We aren't trying to move towards a goal.  Nor is there necessarily a meaning to our actions.  We exist because the situation necessitated our existence.  We act because we are induced to act.

<h3>Causal Determinism may be right for you if...</h3>

<h4>Other philosophies don't seem reasonable to you</h4>

Causal determinism can be a more intuitive philosophy than other options.  There isn't really a question of "why should this be true," because causality is something that is generally assumed to be true.  Breaks from causality are more remarkable.  When we aren't sure why something happened, we want it explained.  If we know why something happened, all is right with the world.

<h4>You're tired of being angry</h4>

This is why I'm writing about this now.  One of the things that I've seen over and over again today is the simple phrase "I'm tired."  Being angry is exhausting.  It can feel hopeless.  Causal determinism offers you an out.  I'll go into this in more detail a bit later on.
