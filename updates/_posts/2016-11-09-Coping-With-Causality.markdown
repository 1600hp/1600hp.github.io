Hello.  I am a causal determinist.  I'm about to explain what that means, why it matters, and probably some other stuff.  First, the one-sentence version:

<em>Causal Determinism is the view that events happen because things cause them.</em>

Before we get into it, a brief disclaimer: I am not a professional.  I mostly don't know shit about philosophy.  The description I'm writing here is highly personal, and I am by no means saying that this is the only way to be a causal determinist.

<h2>What is Causal Determinism?</h2>

Causal determinism (pronounced "cause-ahl," not "casual") is a philisophical view on why things happen.  Put simply, it's the idea that things happen because prior conditions cause them to happen.

On its own, that seems pretty reasonable, right?  Well, to undersand why this is a controversial idea to many people, we can think about what it precludes or contradicts.  If causal determinism is real, then free will doesn't exist: a choice is just the only possible decision based upon our past experiences and mental state. It also precludes luck, certain religious concepts, and some more well-known forms of determinism.

Okay, so maybe this isn't as clear cut as it originally sounded.  Remember that I'm not saying "this is how it is."  Causal determinism is a system of belief.  I am aware of no way to prove it right or wrong.  Believing in it is a choice.

I absolutely do not think everyone should buy into this.  The implications are harsh, and if you aren't prepared to fully accept them, it will seem like a really depressing worldview.  For some, though, it has a lot of merit, both as a way of understanding the world, and a way of coping with it.  I, of course, am in the latter group, or I wouldn't be writing this now, would I?

<h3>Life as a Pool Table</h3>

The analogy I always end up using is a pool table.  In simplified terms, pool tables are quite predictable.  The imperfections of the table, the precise angle of the cue's impact, and innumerable other factors, though, combine to make prediction an estimate at best.

To a causal determinist, this is the case only because of a lack of knowledge.  A human cannot predict the motion of the table, because a human cannot know the state of the table and the forces that act upon it with the infinitesimal precision required to draw the correct conclusion.  Should that mean that the motion is non-deterministic, that if you set up the table in <em>exactly</em> the same way a second time, the same result will not arise?  In this limited example, I think many would agree with me that the pool table is deterministic, regardless of our ability to predict it.
