<p><em>(Hello.  I'm the same guy from the Grenzo thing.  Big thanks to TooManyCardGames for hosting this deck tech.)</em></p>

<p>Storm is fun.  For the pilot.  This is a constant in all formats in which storm is viable, which is most of them.  Better players than I have demonstrated exactly how true this is in Commander, with lists like <a href="http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/commander-edh/multiplayer-commander-decklists/572535-jeleva-grixis-storm" target="_blank">this one</a>.  While all-in Grixis Storm decks may be the most viable way to win with a high storm count, they have some inherent problems for anyone playing outside a hardcore competitive metagame.  Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining a three-color manabase in an archetype reliant on High Tide is not cheap, and can be inconsistent.</li>
<li>They can be incredibly intimidating, and immediately become the threat at the table.</li>
<li>They don't play nice with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last point is key.  While there is a decent amount of interaction in Jeleva Storm and similar, most lists aren't designed for the long game, and don't have a comfortable plan outside of storming off.  This is a huge deal, because there are absolutely tables at which an early storm kill is the least fun thing to have happen.  So what can you do?  Just not play storm unless your meta is purely competitive?  I'm here to present another option: play storm in a combo-control shell.</p>

<p>The theory behind this is pretty simple.  The deck has two stances: aggressivly play for the combo turn, or be the control player.  Why does this matter?  Well, the main problem storm has is the raw time it takes to resolve the winning turn.  If you're winning turns 3-5, and most of the early turns are land-go, you've just dominated the total time taken by all players with a five minute turn in a ten minute game.  Do this an hour in, after controlling the board and keeping a few other players from winning, and this doesn't seem quite as bad.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't guarantee that this won't still give people the feel-bads.  Storm is not something everyone enjoys playing against, and for some people, the mere fact that it is your win condition will be enough for them to hate you and everything you represent.  Unfortunately, this seems to be true of practically any deck one could play, so I'll just be moving on.</p>

<p>Okay, so now we just need to figure out how to play control and combo with the same deck.  To be honest, the control part on its own is not an easy task.  In a four-player game, the only real types of controlling interaction that scale well are stax and board wipes.  Stax is probably going to interfere with our storm plan, and board wipes can be dead or ineffectual against a variety of types of decks, so we will have to rely on traditional countermagic and spot removal as well.  Both of these scale... poorly.  Holding down an entire table is incredibly difficult.  We need a commander that can recoup some of the advantage lost from spending our cards defensively.  My weapon of choice:  Jori En, Ruin Diver.</p>

<hr>
<p>Jori is unassuming.  She'll generally draw you a card per round, sometimes two, and occassionally none.  The interesting thing here is that as you try to control the table, she'll often be drawing cards in proportion to the number of threats that must be dealt with.  Every time you interact on an opponent's turn, you have an opportunity to spin it into card advantage.  This can actually be enough to tip the scales to where controlling three players is possible.  The other key points Jori hits: she is not necessary for the storm plan, so casting her is usually not seen as threating; and she has relatively low mana cost, allowing her to be played while players are still developing.</p>

<p>Jori isn't exactly conventional, so let's compare her briefly to the other options.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Alternative Commanders</h2>
<h3>Mono Blue</h3>
<p>Baral, Chief of Compliance and Jace, Vrynn's Prodigy are both fairly viable for this archetype.  Each filters your draws in some way, getting you to the card advantage needed to control the board, and each contributes to the storm plan (Baral by being a cost reducer, Jace by flashing back a critical spell, often High Tide).  That said, they don't directly contribute card advantage, and being mono blue removes Past in Flames and Yawgmoth's Will as options, cutting some resilience from the storm plan.</p>
<h3>Blue/Black</h3>
<p>Dralnu, Lich Lord presents an interesting twist on Jace, but the high mana cost and harsh risk make this option unappealing.</p>
<p>Oona, Queen of the Fae is an infinite mana outlet in the command zone.  Aaaand... That's it.  For the archetype we are playing, a commander who is only useful when you are ready to win is not a great commander.</p>
<h3>Blue/Red</h3>
<p>Keranos, God of Storms provides some of the same goodness as Jori, by either drawing a card or controlling the board each turn.  Unfortunately, at five mana, the benefits Keranos provides are not sufficient.  The majority of the time, this is a lightning bolt once per turn, which is just not enough.</p>
<p>Mizzix of the Izmagnus, and to a lesser extent Melek, Izzet Paragon and Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind, can be powerful commanders, with abilities that contribute directly towards the storm turn.  Unfortunately for the latter, they cost six mana, and unfortunately for Mizzix, he is very much a known quantity.  Mizzix is incredibly dangerous to leave in play, and as a result, he dies.  A lot.  Further, Mizzix is highly build-around, so if he is not in play, the deck becomes significantly worse.  This is just not what we're looking for.</p> 
<p>Nin, the Pain Artist is probably the closest to Jori En, and it would not be unreasonable to run her.  At worst, she's a slow Braingeyser, but when you have other creatures in play, she is repeatable instant speed card draw.  Even better, she's an outlet for infinite mana, and can act as spot removal in an emergency.</p>

<h2>Decklist</h2>

Let's assume you accept that Jori En is a viable commander for a control/storm deck.  Let's take a look at <a href="http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/Jori-combocontrol/" target="_blank">such a deck</a>.

<h3>Win Conditions</h3>

<p>Ultimately, almost every win this deck gets will be through Aetherflux Reservoir.  This card makes achieving lethal storm far easier than cards with the actual storm mechanic.  This win condition, and to a lesser extent Grapeshot, is supported by two combos, both relatively well-known at this point.</p>
<img src="/resources/DramaticScepter.png" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Imprinting Dramatic Reversal on Isochron Scepter with mana rocks gives you arbitrarily large storm, and with mana rocks producing three or more total, infinite mana.  Though this does not win the game on its own, in many circumstances, it is easy to transition this into a win.</p>
<img src="/resources/HelmSightTop.png" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Having Helm of Awakening, Future Sight, and Sensei's Divining Top in play will allow you to repeatedly activate top and recast it for free, effectively drawing your deck and building a massive storm count.</p>

<h3>Everything else</h3>
<p>I'm going to break down most of the deck into several categories.</p>

<h4>Counterspells</h4>
<p>The countermagic suite includes cards that fulfill at least one of the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mana efficient (Mental Misstep, Mindbreak Trap, Swan Song, Rewind, Counterspell)</li>
<li>Highly flexible (Disallow, Cryptic Command, Unsubstantiate, Muddle the Mixture)</li>
<li>Draws cards (Arcane Denial, Remand)</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping roughly to these guidelines lets us split the difference between storm and control.  Mana efficient can often mean that Jori En draws more cards, and that velocity is super important.</p>
<h4>Removal</h4>
<p>The exact mix of removal spells is something I'm constantly messing with, but here's some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spot Removal</li>
<ul>
<li>Creatures (Lightning Bolt, Pongify, Snap)</li>
<li>Artifacts (Dack Fayden, Shattering Pulse, Vandalblast)</li>
<li>Flexible (Chaos Warp, Metamorphose)</li>
</ul>
<li>Mass Removal (All is Dust, Blasphemous Act, Cyclonic Rift</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it's rare to get removal mixed into card draw in these colors, I focus on extreme mana efficiency for Jori, with the exception of the more flexible answers in these colors.</p>
<h4>Draw/Filtering</h4>
<h4>Storm</h4>
<h4>Ramp</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cost Reducers (Baral, Chief of Compliance, Goblin Electromancer, Helm of Awakening, Sapphire Medallion)</li>
<li>Mana Rocks (Wayfarer's Bauble, Thran Dynamo, Sol Ring, Mind Stone, Mana Vault, Izzet Signet, Gilded Lotus, Fellwar Stone, Chrome Mox)
</ul>
<h4>Lands</h4>
