<p><em>(Hello.  I'm the same guy from the Grenzo thing.  Big thanks to TooManyCardGames for hosting this deck tech.)</em></p>

<p>Storm is fun.  For the pilot.  This is a constant in all formats in which storm is viable, which is most of them.  Better players than I have demonstrated exactly how true this is in Commander, with lists like <a href="http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/commander-edh/multiplayer-commander-decklists/572535-jeleva-grixis-storm" target="_blank">this one</a>.  While all-in Grixis Storm decks may be the most viable way to win with a high storm count, they have some inherent problems for anyone playing outside a hardcore competitive metagame.  Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining a three-color manabase in a archetype reliant on High Tide is not cheap, and can be inconsistent.</li>
<li>They can be incredibly intimidating, and immediately become the threat at the table.</li>
<li>They don't play nice with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last point is key.  While there is a decent amount of interaction in Jeleva Storm and similar, most lists aren't designed for the long game, and don't have a comfortable plan outside of storming off.  This is a huge deal, because there are absolutely tables at which an early storm kill is the least fun thing to have happen.  So what can you do?  Just not play storm unless your meta is purely competitive?  I'm here to present another option: play storm in a combo-control shell.</p>

<p>The theory behind this is pretty simple.  The deck has two stances: aggressivly play for the combo turn, or be the control player.  Why does this matter?  Well, the main problem storm has is the raw time it takes to resolve the winning turn.  If you're winning turns 3-5, and most of the early turns are land-go, you've just dominated the total time taken by all players with a five minute turn in a ten minute game.  Do this an hour in, after controlling the board and keeping a few other players from winning, and this doesn't seem quite as bad.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't guarantee that this won't still give people the feel-bads.  Storm is not something everyone enjoys playing against, and for some people, the mere fact that it is your win condition will be enough for them to hate you and everything you represent.  Unfortunately, this seems to be true of practically any deck one could play, so I'll just be moving on.</p>

<p>Okay, so now we just need to figure out how to play control and combo with the same deck.  To be honest, the control part on its own is not an easy task.  In a four-player game, the only real types of controlling interaction that scale well are stax and board wipes.  Stax is probably going to interfere with our storm plan, and board wipes can be dead or ineffectual against a variety of types of decks, so we will have to rely on traditional countermagic and spot removal as well.  Both of these scale... poorly.  Holding down an entire table is incredibly difficult.  We need a commander that can recoup some of the advantage lost from spending our cards defensively.  My weapon of choice:  Jori En, Ruin Diver.</p>

<img src="/resources/Jori.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">

<hr>
<p>Jori is unassuming.  She'll generally draw you a card per round, sometimes two, and occassionally none.  The interesting thing here is that as you try to control the table, she'll often be drawing cards in proportion to the number of threats that must be dealt with.  Every time you interact on an opponent's turn, you have an opportunity to spin it into card advantage.  This can actually be enough to tip the scales to where controlling three players is possible.  The other key points Jori hits: she is not necessary for the storm plan, so casting her is usually not seen as threating; and she has relatively low mana cost, allowing her to be played while players are still developing.</p>

<p>Jori isn't exactly conventional, so let's compare her briefly to the other options.</p>

<h2>Alternative Commanders</h2>
<h3>Mono Blue</h3>
<p>Baral, Chief of Compliance and Jace, Vrynn's Prodigy are both fairly viable for this archetype.  Each filters your draws in some way, getting you to the card advantage needed to control the board, and each contributes to the storm plan (Baral by being a cost reducer, Jace by flashing back a critical spell, often High Tide).  That said, they don't directly contribute card advantage, and being mono blue removes Past in Flames and Yawgmoth's Will as options, cutting some resilience from the storm plan.</p>
<h3>Blue/Black</h3>
<p>Dralnu, Lich Lord presents an interesting twist on Jace, but the high mana cost and harsh risk make this option unappealing.</p>
<p>Oona, Queen of the Fae is an infinite mana outlet in the command zone.  Aaaand... That's it.  For the archetype we are playing, a commander who is only useful when you are ready to win is not a great commander.</p>
<h3>Blue/Red</h3>
<p>Keranos, God of Storms provides some of the same goodness as Jori, by either drawing a card or controlling the board each turn.  Unfortunately, at five mana, the benefits Keranos provides are not sufficient.  The majority of the time, this is a lightning bolt once per turn, which is just not enough.</p>
<p>Mizzix of the Izmagnus, and to a lesser extent Melek, Izzet Paragon and Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind, can be powerful commanders, with abilities that contribute directly towards the storm turn.  Unfortunately for the latter, they cost six mana, and unfortunately for Mizzix, he is very much a known quantity.  Mizzix is incredibly dangerous to leave in play, and as a result, he dies.  A lot.  Further, Mizzix is highly build-around, so if he is not in play, the deck becomes significantly worse.  This is just not what we're looking for.</p> 
<p>Nin, the Pain Artist is probably the closest to Jori En, and it would not be unreasonable to run her.  At worst, she's a slow Braingeyser, but when you have other creatures in play, she is repeatable instant speed card draw.  Even better, she's an outlet for infinite mana, and can act as spot removal in an emergency.</p>

<h2>Decklist</h2>

Let's assume you accept that Jori En is a viable commander for a control/storm deck.  Let's take a look at <a href="http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/Jori-combocontrol/" target="_blank">such a deck</a>.

<h3>Win Conditions</h3>

<p>Ultimately, almost every win this deck gets will be through Aetherflux Reservoir.  This card makes achieving lethal storm far easier than cards with the actual storm mechanic.  This win condition, and to a lesser extent Grapeshot, is supported by two combos, both relatively well-known at this point.</p>
<img src="/resources/DramaticScepter.png" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Imprinting Dramatic Reversal on Isochron Scepter with mana rocks gives you arbitrarily large storm, and with mana rocks producing three or more total, infinite mana.  Though this does not win the game on its own, in many circumstances, it is easy to transition this into a win.</p>

<img src="/resources/Grenzo.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382276" target="_blank">Grenzo, Dungeon Warden</a>&nbsp;is a pretty strange card. He's one of only three legendary creatures with an X in the mana cost. He is one of only two cards (that I know of) which interact with the bottom of the library beyond just putting things there. Also, his hands are bigger than his face, and he's just funky lookin in general.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>So Wait, What Does Grenzo Do Again?</strong></p>
<p>Grenzo lets you pay two mana (at instant speed, and repeatedly) to put the bottom card of your library into play if it is a creature of lesser or equal power to Grenzo. Since he is an X spell, his power is equal to the mana you choose to pay, letting the selection of creatures you can grab scale with your investment.</p>
<p>This suggests two strategies: either make Grenzo really big, and push out huge monsters on the cheap, or ensure that the creatures in your deck are small enough that even a mini Grenzo can get them. While the former is something I've tried in the past, I'll be discussing the latter here.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>How Can We Win With Just Small Creatures?</strong></p>
<p>Pretty easily, as it turns out. In RB we have access to some pretty nasty creature-based combos, the simplest being <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397698" target="_blank">Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker</a>&nbsp;+ <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=240082" target="_blank">Zealous Conscripts</a>. Oh wait, did I not mention? This is a combo deck. Yes, I'm one of those guys you heard about in the Kangee deck tech. If you didn't want to read about that, you can stop here and go try to play Grenzo with <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=401700" target="_blank">Vampire Nighthawk</a> or <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=121250" target="_blank">Herald of Leshrac</a> or whatever.</p>
<p>I'll wait.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Are they gone? Cool. I lied about waiting.</p>
<p>The other standalone combo we're playing is <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=207876" target="_blank">Necrotic Ooze</a>. Since we spend most of the game milling ourselves, and our curve is pretty low to begin with, the <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=184563" target="_blank">Phyrexian Devourer</a>/<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=206719" target="_blank">Triskelion</a>&nbsp;win isn't very reliable. I've opted for <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397698" target="_blank">Kiki-Jiki</a>&nbsp;+ <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413680" target="_blank">Mogg Fanatic</a>&nbsp;in its place. Tap Necrotic Ooze to copy itself with haste, rinse and repeat until you have half a billion Oozes, then sacrifice them all to ping people to death.</p>
<p>I specify "standalone combo" here because there are numerous loops that require Grenzo to be in play, many of which have interchangable or surprising pieces. I will go over these in more detail later, but for now it's sufficient to get the idea of what the deck is trying to do: flip through as much of the library as possible, stabilize a loop, repeat until you've won.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Just Show Me the List Already.</strong></p>
<p>Fine, fine. You can find the most updated list on Tappedout <a href="http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/combo-grenzo/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Creatures</em></p>
<p>When I activate Grenzo, I want a greater than 50% chance of it paying off. As such, I run over 50 creatures.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoDorks.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Mana dorks are incredibly important to the deck's strategy. Ramping by only one land per turn is not sufficient, so there needs to be some amount of creatures that give you consistent mana increases across turns. This is both so you can flip increasingly large numbers of cards (which get you more mana), and so you can cast actual spells while still holding up Grenzo activations.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoRituals.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>These creatures provide less reliable mana production, but generally in greater bursts. They allow you to flip more creatures in a turn than normal, leading to unexpected wins.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoRecursion.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Recurring resources is pretty important here, as bringing back a key combo piece from the grave is generally easier than trying to get a funcitonal copy from the library. <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=410019" target="_blank">Epitaph Golem</a>&nbsp;is the sleeper hit here, in its repeatability and the sheer number of combos it enables.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoHaste.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Sources of haste allow you to often play one turn ahead with mana dorks and reanimator creatures.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoRemoval.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>If there's one thing Rakdos is good at, it's removal. This package is relatively small compared to what we could be playing; in a meta with more things like <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193660" target="_blank">Linvala</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397880" target="_blank">Elesh Norn</a>, I would definitely expand this list.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoCombo.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Some combination of these creatures is responsible for the vast majority of the deck's wins. Again, I'll give a more full list of combos later on.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoMisc.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>These guys are more generalized utility. The slots are pretty flexible, none are required for the deck to accomplish its plan.</p>
<p>So there's all your creatures. The non-creatures have to be pretty darn good to justify the slot, so I'll address these individually.</p>
<p><em>Instants</em></p>
<img src="/resources/ChaosWarp.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>The most flexible removal in Rakdos. The <em>only</em> mana-efficient way to permanently deal with enchantments. Required.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoSpotRemoval.png" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>The spot removal I play needs to be either super flexible or so cheap you don't need to pay for it. &nbsp;<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159836" target="_blank">Fire Covenant</a> and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=393924" target="_blank">Snuff Out</a>&nbsp;currently fill those roles.</p>
<img src="/resources/Pyroblast.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413684" target="_blank">Pyroblast</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=202447" target="_blank">Red Blast</a>&nbsp;are really nice "gotchas" to have in your pocket. You could play both; I like just the one to keep the fear in 'em.</p>
<img src="/resources/RakdosCharm.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>None of the modes individually are good enough, but the flexibility lets this make the cut. It has game against nearly any opposing combo, can shut off value engines, and blows up that nasty early game <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420889" target="_blank">Sol Ring</a>. Couldn't ask for more.</p>
<p><em>Sorceries</em></p>
<img src="/resources/DreadReturn.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>This one is something I'm trying out. The flashback on this is the only reason it's here, since it's more likely to hit the grave than it is to be drawn.</p>
<img src="/resources/Vandalblast.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>This should probably go in every red deck, honestly.</p>
<p><em>Artifacts</em></p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoAltar.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Convert a creature into another flip. Seems fair, given that it's roughly a 50% exchange rate with the deck's composition, and it is fair, until you combine it with other cards.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoDoublers.png" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Just double your flips. That's enough. &nbsp;The fact that I'm running <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366426" target="_blank">Bracers</a>&nbsp;should tell you how good Heartstone is.</p>
<img src="/resources/Skullclamp.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Fixes iffy draws, recovers you from certain doom, goes crazy with <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383094" target="_blank">Skirge Familiar</a>. This is banned in modern for a reason.</p>
<img src="/resources/Sol Ring.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Auto-include in... everything?</p>
<p><em>Enchantments</em></p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoEchoes.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Oh boy, this thing. It's worth rephrasing exactly what this card does. Whenever a creature comes into play, on anyone's field, you get one colorless mana per creature you ocntrol that shares a creature type with it. If it was your creature, you get one mana for itself. If you stack triggers such that more creatures come into play with this ability on the stack, you can start getting mana on the order of polynomials. This card is actually absurd. If you untap with it, you will almost always win. I've seen someone try to <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389651" target="_blank">Reclamation Sage</a>&nbsp;it down, only to win in response because I controlled a Shaman, and that gave me enough mana to kill everyone on the stack. Of all the cards in the deck, this is the single one that will win the game on its own.</p>
<p>...What's that? You say there's one more? Oh... that one.</p>
<img src="/resources/GrenzoDoomsday.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Okay, so <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=15397" target="_blank">Doomsday</a>. You cast it, stack the 5 cards you need to win, activate Grenzo once, and you win. The competitive EDH version of Grenzo does exactly this, because it is in fact the most efficient, deterministic way to win with Grenzo. It's also, uhhhh... super boring. For the sake of fun, I generally don't cast this card that often. It's just way too easy, and turns the game into "Do you have an answer, like, right now? k i win."</p>
<p>If you really want to know what Doomsday piles work best:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can't cast Grenzo as a 3/3, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370496" target="_blank">Mad Auntie</a>&nbsp;will be in the pile.</li>
<li>If you don't have enough mana to burn the whole pile, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=6156">Workhorse</a>&nbsp;will be in there.</li>
<li>If you need even more mana, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397698" target="_blank">Kiki-Jiki</a>&nbsp;can copy <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=6156">Workhorse</a>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>Finish with <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=240082" target="_blank">Zealous Conscripts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If that won't work for whatever reason, you have to think. Odds are you won't have to think very hard. The only time I had to try when casting Doomsday, an errant <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=402079">Newlamog</a>&nbsp;exiled a piece of every combo I had available.&nbsp;I could still find a way to win.</p>
<p><em>Lands</em></p>
<p>I've found running about 32 lands to be good for this deck. It can't afford to run too many real mana rocks, and there isn't all that much card draw, so going below that is pretty risky. Too many, and you dilute your Grenzo activations too much.</p>
<p>For the most part, this is the standard semi-budget Red/Black manabase. Notable inclusions are <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205421" target="_blank">Cabal Coffers</a>, which is pretty much only good if you accidentally the long game, and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=378536" target="_blank">Temple of Malice</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420944" target="_blank">Spinerock Knoll</a>, and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=139513" target="_blank">Howltooth Hollow</a>. These get their value from being able to stack the bottom of the library to some extent, allowing you to plan your flips in advance.</p>
<p><em>Notable Exclusions</em></p>
<p>The most obvious missing cards are tutors. <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413654" target="_blank">Vampiric Tutor</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394025" target="_blank">Demonic Tutor</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413674" target="_blank">Gamble</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26422" target="_blank">Diabolic Intent</a>, and more could all find their way into this list. As far as I'm concerned, they take a lot of the fun out of this deck, though. I'd never begrudge anyone for running them, but in a deck where the optimal play is almost always to tutor for <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=15397" target="_blank">Doomsday</a>, then cast Doomsday, then win... No thanks.</p>
<img src="/resources/Badlands.png" style="display:block;margin:auto">
<p>Many cards are excluded for budget reasons. <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382852" target="_blank">Badlands</a>, fetchlands, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=184716" target="_blank">Imperial Recruiter</a>, and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420603" target="_blank">Mana Crypt</a>&nbsp;are probably the biggest of these. None of them are really necessary, but all would be nice to have.</p>
<p>With an average CMC of 2.94, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=174915" target="_blank">Ad Nauseum</a>&nbsp;is not at its best here, and even if it were included, drawing tons of cards actually helps surprisingly little. Mana is nearly always the biggest constraint under which the deck works, not cards.</p>
<p><em>Budget</em></p>
<p>You can pick up this list for under $200. With a simpler manabase, it can still function reasonably well and drops to well below $150. Start dropping <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=192230">Bloodghast</a>, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=124474">Simian Spirit Guide</a>, and a few others, and you can go even lower without significantly affecting the functionality of the deck. What I'm saying is, as far as commander decks go, this one is pretty darn cheap if you want it to be.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Okay, I Didn't Read Any of That. How Do I Play?</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, I'll follow these guidelines when I play this deck.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always cast Grenzo for X=1, or three power. This lets you get everything in the deck except for <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=207876" target="_blank">Necrotic Ooze</a>, which will probably end up getting reanimated anyway. Only cast Grenzo for X=2 if it doesn't prevent you from activating an additional time, and even then probably not.</li>
<li>Never activate Grenzo at sorcery speed unless you're trying to win right now, or there's a problem you can't let someone untap with. You have instant speed interaction. Make sure your opponents know it. Even if you can't bluff, it's always possible to flip into something that opponents assess as a threat; it's better to do this when they can't answer at sorcery speed.</li>
<li>Don't always cast Grenzo as soon as possible. If you have stuff to do in your hand, it's sometimes worth running out mana and utility creatures when they don't have to compete with Grenzo activations. The longer Grenzo stays on the field, the more likely he is to die, and that can be a major tempo hit if you don't have recovery options.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Where's That List of Combos You Promised?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, fine. This is a partial list. I'm constantly finding new combos and interactions.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397698" target="_blank">Kiki-Jiki</a>&nbsp;+ <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=240082" target="_blank">Conscripts</a>&nbsp;= Infinite hasty attackers</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=207876" target="_blank">Necrotic Ooze</a>&nbsp;+ <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397698" target="_blank">Kiki-Jiki</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413680" target="_blank">Mogg Fanatic</a>&nbsp;in the graveyard = Infinite damage</p>
<p>(The remaining combos require <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382276" target="_blank">Grenzo</a>&nbsp;on the field, usually at X=1)</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=39571" target="_blank">Mana Echoes</a>&nbsp;+ some quantity of starting mana = You probably win somehow</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=15397" target="_blank">Doomsday</a>&nbsp;+ 2 mana + Grenzo = You win however you want</p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413760" target="_blank">Ashnod's Altar</a>&nbsp;+ <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=207924" target="_blank">Heartstone</a>/<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366426" target="_blank">Illusionist's Bracers</a>/<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366432">Ogre Slumlord</a>/<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=401697">Pawn of Ulamog</a> = Every creature results in two more flips. Since we play over 50% creatures, on average this flips the deck, especially considering the creatures that add mana on their own.</p>

<p><strong>This Guy is Confusing. I Want to Play Something Else.</strong></p>
<p>Well, if you want something from Rakdos specifically, you might have a bad time. Playable legends are relatively slim in this color pairing, with the best options likely being <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220557" target="_blank">Kaervek the Merciless</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253532" target="_blank">Rakdos, Lord of Riots</a>. Yes, I know <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420666" target="_blank">Vial Smasher</a>&nbsp;is a card. I also know that it's never just red/black, also shut up. Anyway, these clearly lend themselves to quite different strategies than Grenzo.</p>
<p>If you don't like Rakdos, and I wouldn't blame you, you can find similar abilities in <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383442" target="_blank">Yisan</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420736" target="_blank">Alesha</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420663" target="_blank">Thrasios</a>, and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=376407" target="_blank">Mayael the Anima</a>. All of these have their individual limitations relative to the Dungeon Warden, and their strengths.</p>

<p><strong>This Has Gone On Way Too Long, Wrap it Up.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382276" target="_blank">Grenzo, Dungeon Warden</a>&nbsp;is a pretty cool guy. I've been playing him since I pulled the card in a Conspiracy draft over two years ago, and there's always something new to find. Practically every set gives him new toys to play with, even for a relatively focused combo list like this one. The fact that I wrote just... way too much about this should make it clear how much I like this deck. It's really cool.</p>
