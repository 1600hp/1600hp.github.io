Well, here we are.  I made a website, sort of.  I'll be tinkering with this occasionally to learn html/css, as well as posting actual stuff I do when I get bored.  We'll just have to see how seriously I take this.  The site is in a stable enough place that I'm relatively confident I won't need to drastically change the format in the near future.  As for what will go here, I'm not really sure.  I'm even less sure that anyone is reading this post.  If you are, why are you still reading?  This obviously isn't going anywhere.
