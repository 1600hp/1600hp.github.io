(If you missed the primer for Grenzo, Dungeon Warden, catch up with the full dech tech <a href="https://toomanycardgames.com/2017/03/01/magic-the-gathering-competitive-edh-primer-grenzo-dungeon-warden-who-pays-for-their-creatures/" target="_blank">here</a>.)

I was recently able to trade for a few cards with which to upgrade my Grenzo EDH list.  Here's the thought process behind these particular improvements.

Chrome Mox is the shakiest of the additions.  It's currently taking the place of a land, to provide slightly more speed getting out of the gate.  As is always the case with fast mana, it also lets me turn card-draw intensive lines (such as with <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394075" target="_blank">Grim Haruspex</a>) into mana to continue playing.  Time will hopefully show whether the incremental improvements it adds are worth the card disadvantage.

The first three fetches to be acquired for Grenzo.  I'm hoping to pick up more as I go.  Beyond the simple duties of mana fixing and consistency, the fetches do a fair amount in Grenzo in particular.  While they could be played in any deck to ever-so-slightly decrease the number of lands remaining in the library, with Grenzo up and running, this is twice as effective, as you are pulling cards off of both the top and the bottom.  There is also incremental synergy with the Hideaway lands, but that's less concerning than the main two benefits.

And finally, Blood Moon and Magus of the Moon.  Blood Moon was a trade from the latest Modern Masters set, and I'm interested to see how it works.  I have essentially no experience playing with this card, but I am hoping my relatively high Swamp count will make the downsides negligible.  Magus of the Moon is essentially just a better version, since it is a viable Grenzo hit.

Well, that's about it for the updates.  It feels good to finally be comfortable with my list to the point where I can start focusing on pricier additions.  For the future, hopefully more fetches, Magus of the Moon, Dark Confidant, and more.
