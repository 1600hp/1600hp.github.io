This Saturday (technically tomorrow, let's not talk about that) is a Yu-Gi-Oh regional.  I'm playing in it, which doesn't happen often, and I'm playing in the main event, which happens even more rarely.  I'll be taking a look at what exactly my weapon of choice this format is, how it works, and some matchup information from testing.

To start with, here's a bunch of cards.

<h3>What is this</h3>
Well that's... uh... certainly something.  You can call this "Kaiju Yang Zing Speedroid Deskbot Nekroz Synchron Plants" without being entirely inaccurate, but that's a mouthful and doesn't actually describe the deck very well.  If you want to call it something, Synchro Plants isn't far off (I only run six plants, but that's not far off from old-school Plant Synchro).  Personally, I call it Hot Potatoes because of reasons.

But that's enough of semantics.  What does it do?  On the most basic level, the intent is to get as consistent access as possible to the best synchros that it is convenient to make.  We're talking these guys:

Among these five, we theoretically have access to everything necessary to steal games.  <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Trishula,_Dragon_of_the_Ice_Barrier">Trishula</a> and <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Baxia%2C_Brightness_of_the_Yang_Zing">Baxia</a> give access to powerful removal.  <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Crystal_Wing_Synchro_Dragon">Crystal Wing</a>, <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Naturia_Beast">Naturia Beast</a>, and <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Hot_Red_Dragon_Archfiend_Abyss">Archfiend Abyss</a> act as oppressive lock pieces.  The deck is essentially geared to make these and ride them to victory.

<h3>How do I even</h3>
I'd explain how to play this deck if it weren't for a couple of factors.  One, I'm tired and it would take like a dozen more pages than I'm willing to write.  Two, I'm not entirely sure I can explain it.  I've been playing some variant or predecessor of this deck for close to three years at this point.  Play it long enough, and you'll be able to feel your way through plays without needing to know exactly where you're going or how your opponent will respond.  Try that without having played it very long, and well...  There's a reason that despite having used this in the same playgroup for ages, I don't know a single person who could pick it up and play with it comfortably.  

Instead of that, let's talk extremes.  As with any deck, the power level varies depending upon the hand.  The variance level, though, is crazy high.  Some hands give the player access to essentially anything in their extra deck, while others are simply unplayable.  The good news is that the whole hand doesn't need to be strong to make strong plays.  Some of the more memorable plays in this deck require only two cards.  Let's walk through a few of those.

<h4>Easy Nat Beast</h4>
Start with Terrortop and anything that gives access to a level one Earth tuner (25% of the deck's cards can fill this role).  Terrortop for Taketomborg, make <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/M-X-Saber_Invoker">M-X-Saber Invoker</a> and use it to summon Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades.  Using this and your tuner, make Naturia Beast.

<h4>Kaiju Abyss</h4>
Start with Interrupted Kaiju Slumber and some way to get to Glow-Up Bulb or Jet Synchron.  Blow up the field, and use the tuner to make Scarlight.  This can nuke the opponent's Kaiju, and then makes Hot Red Abyss with the bought-back tuner.

<h4>Easy Crystal Wing</h4>
Start with Lonefire and Taketomborg.  Summon Lonefire into Spore, sync that with Taketomborg for <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Herald_Of_The_Arc_Light">Herald of the Arc Light</a>.  Banish Lonefire to bring back Spore as a 4, and make Crystal Wing (searching for a ritual monster along the way).

<h4>The Anything Combo</h4>
Start with Lonefire and <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Hippo_Carnival">Carnival</a>.  Use Lonefire to get Dandylion, and overlay that with Hip Hippo for <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Meliae_of_the_Trees">Meliae</a>.  Detach Dandylion to get Lonefire and two tokens.  From here, you can do just about anything, including Herald + Naturia Beast, Crystal Wing + Angineer, and Baxia with reborn fodder.

Plays like these are the bread and butter of the deck.  Anything on top of these plays (Instant Fusions, One-for-one, Foolish Burial, Soul Charge) pushes them from strong to absurd.  The trick is that we don't have access to the filtering of the Blue Eyes deck, or the staying power of PK Fire.  We have to work with what we draw, every time.  This is a problem, as there's a lot of cards in the deck that you just never want to draw.  I've learned to accept this as the cost of doing business.

<h3>On going second</h3>
I always go second if given the choice.  I've learned from experience that it is absurdly difficult to set up a lock with five cards that your opponent can't break with six.  You may steal a few wins that way, but it isn't the way we prefer to operate.  We run Kaijus and Twin Twisters to break through whatever our opponent tried to do, and once we get their annoying interaction out of the way, we can hopefully go to town on their field.  Unless you happen to kill them, you want to end with them having significantly fewer cards than they did before, and with a lock piece or two on your field.

<h3>On going first</h3>
Sometimes you have to go first.  The plan here changes slightly depending on the matchup, but the general suggestion is not to overextend unless you think you can prevent them from playing entirely.  If you go all in on one play, and they kill it, you will lose.

In some matchups, you want to go first.  This applies to nonsense like the Herald of Perfection deck, and anything that can get completely shut down by a Nat Beast.  We can side in traps and floodgates for these matchups.

<h3>Specific matchups</h3>
I'm about to sleep for a bunch, so I'll keep these quick.

<h4>Domain Monarchs</h4>
Go first if able.  Side heavily for this matchup.  We need to be able to play in order to win.

<h4>Extra Deck Monarchs</h4>
One of the most fair matchups, to be honest.  Prefer to go second, it's unlikely they'll be able to lock us out entirely.  This matchup demands planning ahead and tight play.

<h4>Pendulums</h4>
Pretty much the only concern here is <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Majespecter_Unicorn_-_Kirin">Kirin</a>, but it's a big one.  Prefer to go first, and side heavily into things like Vanity's, Solemn, and Book of Eclipse.  Make Naturia Beast early and often.  Try not to rely on hitting the scales and hoping they can't reset.  They will be able to reset.  It's a fact of life.

<h4>Blue Eyes</h4>
Spirit Dragon is a huge deal.  You can't Slumber it.  It shuts off Dandylion and Soul Charge and your first graveyard trigger every turn.  In an emergency it swaps for Moonlight and kills your play.  Who thought this card was fair?  Regardless, this matchup isn't impossible, which is good because I'll probably run into it a lot.  Crystal Wing is key against this deck.  Their only substantial answer is a rank 8, and if you can back the Crystal Wing with a Naturia Beast or Herald, you can push through game quickly.

<h4>PK Fire</h4>
Not a bad matchup, overall.  Baxia is the heavy hitter here.  Try to keep them off balance, and make them react to you rather than reacting to them.

<h4>Kozmo</h4>
Dark Lady is death.  Other than that, we don't care what they do.  Crystal Wing is unbeatable outside of Kozmojo, and between Kaijus and Trishula we can deal with the untargetable stuff.

<h4>Rogue</h4>
Depends what kind.  Anything based on Demise is a struggle, whereas we're generally favored against more "fair" decks.

<h3>So what's gonna happen?</h3>
More than anything else, it depends on luck.  None of these matchups is outright unwinnable, nor are any of them easy.  Often you can tell who's going to win just by comparing opening hands, since games are generally over before the sixth turn and often before the fourth.  I've done my best to tune the deck, pushing unplayable hands down to a minimum.  This is why you don't see handtraps, nor do you see the Nekroz of Trishula that was in here for a significant period of time, nor "cute" things like Trick Clown or Electromagnetic Turtle.

So how's the regional going to go?  We'll just have to see.
