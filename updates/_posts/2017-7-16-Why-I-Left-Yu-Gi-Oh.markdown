I'm going to try to keep this organized and focused, because there's way more that I could say than anyone actually wants to read.  But I feel like I need to get this written down.

When Link format hits, I'm not playing Yu-Gi-Oh anymore.

I already stopped playing in paper, dissolved my decks, and sold some of the more expensive stuff.  I've kept playing a bit on YGOpro, because some habits are hard to break.  But by the time this article is posted, I'll have uninstalled that as well.

To understand why, I have to get into why I was playing the game.  In terms popularized by Mark Rosewater <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2002-03-08" target="_blank">here</a>, I am a Johnny with a bit of Spike.  That means that the enjoyment that I get out of card games is focused around creating something that is my own, and more specifically, something that is at least a little competitively viable.

For most of the six years I've played this game, that's been possible.  It's certainly been difficult, and easier at some times than others (compare HAT format to Dragon Ruler format).  On the whole, though, I've been able to play something that's able to take games from top decks, and it's been something that was wholely mine.  I'm going to briefly talk about what I've played, because it might be relevant later.  If you already know, or just don't care, feel free to skip the following section.

In recent years, I've focused on two decks that I considered competitive.  The first was originally created in the summer of 2014 as a Monster Mash deck.  It's progressed a lot over the subsequent years, but some aspects have persisted.  I gave it the name "Potatoes" (Monster Mash > Mash > Mashed Potatoes).
</p><p>
When I finally stopped playing it in paper, it looked like <a href="https://1600hp.github.io/videos/2017/02/24/A-Farewell-To-Potatoes.html" target="_blank">this</a>.  It had transformed into an all-in OTK deck.  I truly believe that this is the only form this deck can take.  Any combo-oriented deck like this that isn't meta probably can't set up a strong enough turn 1 board consistently, because if it could, it would be meta.  It probably also can't play the long game, because you don't have the resources to beat tier 1 strategies.  As a result, the optimal way to win is to do it in one turn.
</p><p>
I didn't like doing that.  It generally is solitaire.  The times when your opponent has interaction that it is possible to beat but non-obvious are few, so with enough practice I can essentially just play on auto-pilot around 90% of the time.  It was the only way to stay viable, though.
</p><p>
To contrast with this strategy, I had made Ghostricks.  This deck is generally considered a gimmicky stall deck, and I agree that it is often built that way.  I think that's very incorrect, though.  I built it as a tempo deck, keeping your opponent off-balance for long enough to swing in with your Ghostrick Angels and the occasional beater provided by Rank-Up-Magic: Limited Barian's Force.  Somehow, when building it, I always ended up about 15 cards short, and there were a number of engines that could slot in.  I liked Darkworlds, seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm7_JxGbTU8" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p><p>
Matchups varied widely.  My favorite was against Shaddolls, pre-Construct ban (so 2015).  The games tended to go into time, as both decks ended up playing the grind game, but I considered myself generally favored, with better recursion and innevitability.
</p><p>
Both of these decks are fun to play.  I made both very much my own.  I spent months on Ghosts, and <em>years</em> on Potatoes.  And once the Link rules become official, neither will be playable anymore.
