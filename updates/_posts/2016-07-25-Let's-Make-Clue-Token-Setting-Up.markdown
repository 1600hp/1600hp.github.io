(Fair warning: If you don't play Magic, you probably want to skip this first paragraph.  On second thought, you should probably just skip all the text.  Basically just look at the pictures.)

Investigate is a really weird mechanic.  It can be pretty hard to evaluate, and generally, I don't try very hard.  It is, however, quite satisfying to use.  I run Tireless Tracker and Trail of Evidence in a pretty fun Cromat EDH list, and while they're probably not optimal, they're both cards I am very rarely sad to draw.  There's a copy of Ongoing Investigation in the mail that I'm gonna shove somewhere it probably doesn't belong.  The point is, clues are fun.  They can be confusing, though; it's easy to forget that they're there, repurpose the die that was representing them as counters, or otherwise mess up the gamestate, especially in the extremely durdly boardstates that such passive advantage engines provoke.  I've used the official Clue tokens, and I'm honestly not a fan.  It's annoying to carry around a spare card specifically for this purpose when the rest of my tokens are more substantial.

So what does it take to make a Clue token that I can enjoy using?  As with my previous tokens, the following:

- A scrap of medium density fiberboard (MDF)
- A pocketknife
- Basic drawing supplies
- A high powered laser cutting tool

Okay, so the do-it-yourself quality kind of decreases with that last one, but I'm gonna go ahead and use the tools I have available.  I got rapid prototyping training a few years back.  Sue me.

Now, I have a pretty fixed design for my tokens, modeled off the real token template.  I've made a couple aesthetic changes, and I'll have to make one more here: no Power/Toughness boxes.  That space is kind of empty now, so maybe add some extra detail - something like this?

Alright, that'll work.  I suppose I should mention the software I'm using to draft this up.  Solidworks is a powerful CAD program that UPenn's Virtual Lab gives me access to.  I've tried lower-power software like Draftsight and Solidworks 2D; the former needs an extra conversion step, and the latter is much more difficult for me to work with.  I'll stick with the overkill solution.

At this point, we need a card image.  I generally don't use an image from a token.  Instead, I pick a well-known card that's representative of what the token actually is.  For a 1/1 soldier, Champion of the Parish.  For a 4/4 angel, Serra Angel.  This keeps things easy to parse on the field.  Fewer people will recognize the art of whatever generic token I choose than would recognize a more iconic image.  This does sort of pose a problem when it comes to Clues, however.  What can you use that's visually pleasing, easily recognizable, and has an at least similar text box?  For this, I chose Mishra's Bauble.

As trinkets go, this one is pretty neat.  As cycling effects go, it's a bit convoluted, and that's kind of perfect for this.  It's a delayed card draw effect on a zero cost artifact.  Close enough for my tastes.  Mishra's Bauble doesn't see a ton of play, so its absurd price tag is a bit of a mystery to me, but it's a distinctive enough image.  On a more subjective note, it looks friggin sweet.

Now we have the image.  Time to shamelessly plagiarize it.  This step is both easier and harder than it sounds.  It's easier, because Solidworks lets me straight-up trace the image, but it's harder because I'm translating a greyscale picture into positive space, negative space, and etched lines.  Cuts through the MDF can't be too close, or the material will burn up.  Negative and positive space need to be balanced, so that it doesn't look weird.  Material can't be too isolated, or it will snap easily.  I'll be subtly modifying the image to keep it workable but still aesthetically pleaseing in this format.

Once this is done, the only thing left to do on the digital end is differentiate cuts and etches.  I'll be doing some knife-work on the interior to improve the latice-like appearance, so I'll constrain my true negative space to the "background" of the art, and the circle in which the spindown will eventually be placed.

Now that everything is set up digitally, I need to move to the physical side.  Unfortunately, I don't actually have MDF on me, so I won't be able to actually finish this particular token quite yet.  Look for a follow-up to this post to see how it turns out!
